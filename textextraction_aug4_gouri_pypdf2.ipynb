The original total amount was 8.5M in aggregate in which there was an upfront dividend of I believe 4.0M,followed by three instalments of 1.5M. The agreement references a total of 4.5 and says 3M paid todate. Unless the final agreement bifurcated these two dividends, I would be concerned that this might causeconfusion with the estate folks.These amounts were taken directly from the Dividend Agreement as the 54 million was paid prior to enteringinto it. However, I can make reference in the recitals to the fact that $+ million was already paid so as to avidconfusion.2. I have drafted my invoice to Airia Holdings so as to avoid our new client acceptance process on the premisethat Kyle is entitled to hold back our fees. I don't see a mechanism for that hold back in the letterThis will be handled in a direction from the Estate as to the payment of funds. I will also do an invoice ofSSf. ts the dealthat the estate pays the entire St0f or that they split it up to the amount of S10K. Also, shouldthe invoice not go to Kyle as she is the purchaser, not Airia?3. The letter references withholding taxes, of which there should be none and the Estate is likely going to likelyget excited about that. Can we eliminate that or if you feel we need it to protect ourselves can we commentthat we are not anticipating withholding taxes as the shares are to our knowledge not Taxable CanadianProperty and the disposition is expected to give rise to a capital gain.Withholding taxes are covered expressly in the put/call agreement so no need to expressly reference it again. Iwill delete that sentence.4. I think we wanted something in here regarding this as a settlement of all liabilities to the estate. As you mayrecall there was a hand written note that Rainer penned suggesting there was still a 300k debt to besettled. For clarity part of this agreement was to settle any claim or potential claim that might be raised inrespect of the note. This will be handled in a separate release.
